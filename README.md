# Codon_to_Protein Visualizer

## Description
A beginner-friendly bioinformatics tool that translates a DNA sequence into its corresponding protein sequence and displays amino acid properties. Outputs are saved in a text file.

## Features
- Input any DNA sequence (A, T, G, C)
- Splits DNA into codons
- Translates DNA to protein
- Shows amino acid properties (hydrophobic, polar, acidic, basic)
- Saves output to `outputs/protein_output.txt`

## How to Run
1. Make sure Python 3 is installed.
2. Install Biopython: pip install biopython
3. Run the script: python codon_to_protein.py
4. Enter your DNA sequence when prompted.

## Example
Input DNA: `ATGGGCTTT`  
Output Protein: `MGF`  
Amino acid properties: 
M: hydrophobic
G: hydrophobic
F: hydrophobic
